# Read One Article

This is a Wikipedia game inspired by ["Two Of These People Are Lying"](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfx61sxf1Yz2I-c7eMRk9wBUUDCJkU7H0), a YouTube format by Tom Scott & Matt Grey.

It's been edited to work for two people stuck in confinement, since without this game, you wouldn't be able to keep one of the articles secret.

## Development

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.

You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
